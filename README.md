# 🧪 Error Handling File Modifier

## 📘 Description
This Python program demonstrates **file handling** and **error management**.  
It reads the content of a file, modifies it (for example, by converting all text to uppercase),  
and then writes the modified version to a new file.

It also handles common file errors gracefully  such as when:
- The file does not exist 🫠  
- You don’t have permission to read or write it 🚫  
- Any other unexpected error occurs ⚠️

 Features
- Reads content from a user-specified file.
- Modifies the content (e.g., converts text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified text to a new file (`modified_<filename>`).
- Includes strong error handling for missing or inaccessible files.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your computer.
2. Save the program as `file_modifier.py`.
3. Place a sample text file (e.g., `notes.txt`) in the same directory.
4. Run the program from the terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python file_modifier.py
